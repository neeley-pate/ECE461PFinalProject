# ECE461PFinalProject
This is the repository of our work on the ECE 461 P Final Project. Below is a description of the contents of each folder.

## Classifiers
This folder contains two scripts: one script with all models running on original data, and one script with all models running on the PCA data. The models run were decision trees, logistic regression, MLP, XGBoost, and Catboost. These scripts include the data splits, training, and hyper paraemeters of each model. The scripts also include the ROC AUC curve graphs, PR curve graphs, confusion matrices, accuracy metrics, and notable feature graphs. The folder also contains two CSVs with the output labels of the models trained on the original data and the models trained on the PCA data compared to the true labels.
